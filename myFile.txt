In your github fork, you need to keep your master branch clean, by clean I mean without any changes, like that you can create at any time a branch from your master. Each time, that you want to commit a bug or a feature, you need to create a branch for it, which will be a copy of your master branch.

When you do a pull request on a branch, you can continue to work on another branch and make another pull request on this other branch.

Before creating a new branch pull the changes from upstream, your master needs to be up to date.

Create the branch on your local machine and switch in this branch :

$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
Push the branch on github :

$ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]

When you want to commit something in your branch, be sure to be in your branch.

You can see all branches created by using :

$ git branch
Add a new remote for your branch :

$ git remote add [name_of_your_remote] 

Push changes from your commit into your branch :

$ git push origin [name_of_your_remote]

Update your branch when the original branch from official repository has been updated :

$ git fetch [name_of_your_remote]
